# SpeedReader

This program was built to train students read faster utilizing Rapid Serial Visual Presentation (RSVP). 
With RSVP, words are presented quickly in succession. 
By design, the reader is only able to focus on a single word at a time. 
Many resources indicate that the average reading speed of most adults is around 200 to 250 words per minute.
With sufficient training using this app, you can read at approximately 2x the average reading rate.
